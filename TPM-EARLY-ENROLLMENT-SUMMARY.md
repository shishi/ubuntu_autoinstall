# TPM Early Enrollment Implementation Summary

## Overview
The `autoinstall-step10-tpm-early.yml` implements TPM enrollment during installation time as requested.

## Key Features

### 1. Installation-Time TPM Enrollment
- Attempts TPM enrollment during the installation process itself (in late-commands)
- Uses `curtin in-target` to access the installed system's environment
- If TPM is accessible during installation, enrollment happens immediately

### 2. Automatic Temporary Password Removal
- The temporary LUKS password is removed as soon as TPM enrollment succeeds
- This happens either during installation or on first boot
- No user intervention required

### 3. Fallback to First Boot
- If TPM enrollment fails during installation (common in virtual environments), it automatically falls back to first boot
- Uses a systemd service that runs very early in the boot process
- Service runs before sysinit.target for earliest possible execution

### 4. Single Recovery Key
- Only one recovery key is generated and stored in `/root/.luks/recovery-key.txt`
- No duplicate keys are created
- Recovery key remains as the only non-TPM unlock method after temporary password removal

## Implementation Details

### Installation-Time Enrollment Process
1. Script is created at `/usr/local/bin/tpm2-enroll-installer.sh`
2. Executed during late-commands phase
3. Checks for TPM device availability
4. If available, enrolls TPM and removes temporary password
5. Updates initramfs for next boot

### First-Boot Fallback Process
1. Systemd service `tpm2-luks-enroll.service` is created and enabled
2. Runs very early in boot sequence (before sysinit.target)
3. Only runs if enrollment didn't happen during installation
4. Removes temporary password upon successful enrollment

### Security Considerations
- Temporary password exists only for the minimal time required
- Recovery key is protected with 600 permissions
- TPM enrollment uses PCRs 0+7 for secure boot validation

## Validation
All configurations have been validated for:
- YAML syntax
- Cloud-init schema compliance
- Autoinstall structure
- Command syntax correctness

## Usage
Use this configuration file for installations where you want:
- TPM-based LUKS unlocking
- Minimal exposure of temporary password
- Automatic enrollment without user intervention
- Single recovery key for emergency access
